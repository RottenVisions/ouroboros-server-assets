This is a Ouroboros server asset library

========

##Starting the server


Start with fixed parameters:

	
	Linux:
		start_server.sh

	Windows:
		start_server.bat


##Close the server


Quickly kill the server process:


	Linux:
		kill_server.sh

	Windows:
		kill_server.bat


If it is a formal operating environment, you should use a secure shutdown method, which ensures data security archiving, safely tells users to go offline, and so on.


	Linux:
		safe_kill.sh

	Windows:
		safe_kill.ba
